Found datasets that use myoband arm gesture sensors

FFT on 8 channels - nonconclusive since data recorded in repeating pattens of gestures ... try windowed?

** Find shape compare to class?

-- Updates for meeting
PCA used to combine the 8 channels
- Separation of geustures not apparent
- Moving average and SD over time is too similar between guestures

Tried DPD (distance of each point per x dimensions)
- Unable to find clusters between or amoung channels based on mean and variance

Moving FFT
- unable to use movfun function (seek suggestions from winfree)

LDA
- Unable to get data in appropreiate formate for train_sc/TEST_SC functions (seek suggestions from winfree)
