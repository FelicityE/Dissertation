-----------------------------------------------
* Current Work
Data Aquisition: 
  Possibly need better real time data
  Bootstrapping to increase available data??

Preprocessing:
  FFT: Need help with mov_fun function / or proper windowing technique in Octave

Dimentionality Reduction:
  PCA: Move to classification/clustering
  - Take new data and transform to new dimension
  - Feed that into classifier

  LDA: Need help with train_sc function in octave/ or writing own LDA function

* Not completed
Classification/clustering:
  LDA?
  ANN
  SVM?

Validation:
  K-fold cross-val
  Rand sum cross-val


Also Maybe try:
Wavelet Transformation
